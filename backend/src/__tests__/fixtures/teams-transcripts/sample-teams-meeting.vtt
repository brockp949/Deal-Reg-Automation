<v John Smith>Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the 4IEC Gateway discussion.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Thanks John. We're looking at deploying 200-300 units for our manufacturing facility.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.000
<v John Smith>That's great to hear. Can you share more about your timeline and requirements?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Sarah Johnson>We need pricing by end of Q1 2026. Target deployment is Q2 2026. Budget is around $150k-$200k for the full rollout.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Michael Chen>I can help with the technical specs. We're looking at edge computing capabilities with real-time data processing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
<v John Smith>Perfect. What about margin expectations? We typically target 25-30% on these deployments.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Sarah Johnson>That works for our budget. Can you send the detailed quote by next Friday?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
<v John Smith>Absolutely. Action item: I'll send the complete RFQ response with pricing breakdown by November 22nd.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Michael Chen>Also, can we schedule a technical deep dive for next week?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Sarah Johnson>Yes, let's set that up. Action item: Schedule technical review meeting for next Wednesday.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
<v John Smith>Great. I'll follow up with calendar invites. Thanks everyone!
