00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Robert Williams: Welcome everyone to the ClearLED Media Player opportunity discussion.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Emily Davis: Thanks for hosting this. We're evaluating options for 500-1000 media player units.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Robert Williams: Excellent. That's a significant deployment. What's driving this initiative?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Emily Davis: We're upgrading our entire digital signage infrastructure across 50 retail locations. Need to move fast - target go-live is Q1 2026.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
David Martinez: I've reviewed your product specs. The 4IEC capabilities are exactly what we need for our edge processing requirements.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Robert Williams: Great to hear. For volume pricing on 500-1000 units, we can offer $350-$400 per unit depending on configuration.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Emily Davis: That's within budget. Total project value would be around $175k-$400k. What kind of margins can you work with?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Robert Williams: For this volume, we can accommodate 20-25% margin while maintaining competitive pricing.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
David Martinez: Sounds good. Next steps - can you provide detailed technical documentation and integration guides?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Robert Williams: Absolutely. Action: I'll send complete technical package by end of this week.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Emily Davis: Perfect. We'll review and get back with purchase order requirements by next month.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Robert Williams: Excellent. Looking forward to working together on this deployment!
